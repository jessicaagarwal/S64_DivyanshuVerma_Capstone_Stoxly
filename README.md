# Stock Market Portfolio Tracker - Project Plan

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Tracking stock investments manually can be challenging, leading to difficulties in monitoring profits/losses, retrieving historical data, and visualizing market trends. Our Stock Market Portfolio Tracker aims to simplify investment tracking by providing real-time stock data, portfolio performance analysis, and market insights in a single platform.

### Solution
A MERN stack web application that enables users to manage their stock portfolios, compare past and current prices, and visualize market trends using real-time stock data.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js (REST API)  
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas  
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **Stock Data**: Alpaca API (for historical data), WebSocket API for real-time stock prices  
- **3D UI Elements**: Three.js for an interactive landing page with 3D animations  
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)
